# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```solidity
	contract SpaceAndTime is ERC20, ERC20Pausable, AccessControl, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
	```

	```solidity
	    function unpause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function nonces(address owner) public view override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-3: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/SpaceAndTime.sol [Line: 20](src/SpaceAndTime.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	        _mint(recipient, 5_000_000_000 * 10 ** decimals());
	```

</details>



## L-4: Loop contains `require`/`revert` statements

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop
